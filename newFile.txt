Hello frome node.js

REPL in node extend for 

R = Read  = Read user input
E = Eval  = Evaluate user input
P = Print = Print out (result)
L = Loop  = Wait for new input

Repl occur when we command node in cmd prompt.

Repl is a great playground as it run in environment we can test any small code and execute as we write it.
